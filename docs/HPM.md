### 5. Incident and Error Tracking
- **Incident Monitoring**: Log incidents involving nurses, such as medication errors or patient falls.
- **Detailed Logs**: Maintain records of incidents with timestamps, descriptions, and outcomes.
- **Pattern Analysis**: Analyze recurring incidents to prevent future occurrences.

### 6. Actionable Interventions
- **Intervention Tools**: Enable supervisors to act on data by scheduling training, reassigning tasks, or sending reminders.
- **Outcome Tracking**: Document interventions and monitor their impact (e.g., performance improvement post-training).
- **Goal Setting**: Set performance goals for nurses and track progress.

### 7. Reporting and Analytics
- **Automated Reports**: Generate weekly or monthly reports summarizing team and individual performance.
- **Customizable Filters**: Allow filtering by nurse, date range, or metric for detailed analysis.
- **Export Functionality**: Export reports for documentation or meetings.

### 8. Recognition and Incentives
- **Identify Top Performers**: Highlight top-performing nurses for recognition.
- **Document Recognition**: Log and share recognition, such as “Nurse of the Month” announcements.
- **Incentive Tracking**: Maintain records of incentives or rewards given to nurses.

### 9. Collaboration Monitoring
- **Team Collaboration**: Assess nurse participation in team activities (e.g., handovers, communication logs).
- **Engagement Identification**: Identify disengaged nurses or those needing teamwork support.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Provide tools to encourage collaboration, such as team-building activity assignments.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Usability
- **Intuitive Interface**: Offer a clear, user-friendly dashboard with minimal clicks to access key data.
